# AI Agent HandBook

Following the agent lifecycle—from architecture and building to operation, governance, and optimization—we share the experience and lessons we have gained from deploying enterprise agents. If this white paper helps individuals learn or organizations put agents into practice, we would be deeply grateful.

We dedicate this project to everyone contributing to the development of AI.

---

## 1. Background and Structure

In September 2025, we published the [AI-Native Application Architecture White Paper](https://developer.aliyun.com/ebook/8479). It examined the full DevOps lifecycle of AI-native applications—from architecture and technology choices to engineering practice, operations, and optimization—breaking down key concepts and difficult problems while offering possible approaches. As models and agent technologies have advanced rapidly, however, attention has shifted from building agents quickly to three new challenges:

- **Engineering:** Turn probabilistic intelligence into reliable productivity so agents can take on critical tasks.
- **Scaling:** Address stability, security, performance, and cost as agents move from isolated experiments to intelligent infrastructure that can be deployed at scale.
- **Organization:** Move beyond isolated agents and bring them into core business processes as part of an intelligent organization.

Last year's white paper can no longer fully address these needs.

We have therefore reworked its structure. With more up-to-date content, a greater share devoted to real-world practice, and a more community-driven approach, we hope to support enterprise technology selection and internal project planning. By maintaining the white paper as an open-source project, we aim to keep sharing emerging thinking and practical experience in AI-native application architecture.

## 2. Audience and Takeaways

This white paper is primarily for teams building and deploying enterprise agents. It can also support technology selection, architecture reviews, project proposals, and a shared vocabulary across organizations.

| Reader | Recommended sections | What you will gain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent and AI application developers | Building, Runtime, Optimization | Engineering methods for harnesses, context, state, tools, sandboxes, trajectories, and evaluation. |
| Architects and platform engineers | Architecture, Runtime, Governance | An architecture spanning components, platform responsibilities, and the application lifecycle. |
| Technology and engineering leaders | Architecture, Governance, Practice | Criteria for application form, maturity, investment boundaries, and production risk. |
| Product and business leaders | Survey, Architecture, Practice | A way to identify suitable tasks, define human-agent responsibilities, and plan the path beyond pilots. |
| Security, quality, and operations teams | Runtime, Governance, Optimization | Approaches to observation, audit, authorization, release validation, evaluation, and root-cause analysis. |
| Researchers and ecosystem contributors | Entire white paper and Practice | First-hand enterprise problems, reusable abstractions, and open questions for further work. |

By the end, you should be able to:

- Choose the least complex agent architecture sufficient for the business goal, task uncertainty, and risk.
- Distinguish model limitations from harness and systems-engineering problems.
- Design tasks that can advance over time, recover from interruption, and finish based on verifiable evidence.
- Provide an execution environment, state, traffic management, permissions, observability, and cost controls.
- Build an improvement loop using traces, trajectories, golden datasets, and evaluation experiments.
- Apply these methods to software engineering, design, operations, enterprise IT, and customer-facing use cases.

## 4. Roadmap

This white paper is an open, evolving project rather than a document frozen after its first release. Planned work includes:

- **More enterprise cases:** Add first-hand examples from engineering, operations, customer service, data, security, finance, and industry-specific workflows, including trade-offs and failure modes.
- **Hands-on cloud experiences:** Create reproducible online exercises for sandboxes, runtimes, AI gateways, state storage, observability, and evaluation.
- **Deeper governance coverage:** Track enterprise needs in identity, prompt-injection defense, data egress, audit, asset registration, versioning, and pre-release simulation.
- **Stronger evaluation methods:** Expand coverage of task success rates, trajectory evaluation, LLM-as-Judge, golden datasets, bad-case regression, online experiments, and quality–cost trade-offs.
- **Ongoing technical updates:** Revisit conclusions as models, harnesses, protocols, runtimes, multi-agent systems, and Agentic OS evolve.
- **Community collaboration:** Improve content guidelines, case templates, terminology, review processes, and release practices.
